# hellokubernetes
Before I make the booksread project, I'm gonna make this one. Simple hello world apps that I can switch up. Find the medium tutorial on how to use this here: https://medium.com/@currypat1985/hello-kubernetes-with-node-flask-and-django-at-the-same-time-4e56e5de9b8d

I am working through the hello minikube stuff on the website kubernetes.
